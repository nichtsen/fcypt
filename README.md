# fcypt
> Quick file encryption/decryption via AES(ECB) 

## Installation
```
go get github.com/nichtsen/fcypt
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nichtsen/fcypt
go build 
```

## filename extension:

* __.key:__ 128-bits key,which should be kept separately from your encrypted file
* __.en:__ encrypted file
* __.de:__ decrypted file that is the same as your original file after the extension being stripped

## TODO
1. clean output files if the process quits with error
2. pad optimization: >= rather than >
3. key file entention shall be unified with respect to C implementation 

## language
[python implementation](https://github.com/nichtsen/symk-fcrypto)
